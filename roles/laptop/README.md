# Laptop

Configures Debian installation to be used on a laptop. 

## Notes

### ALSA

Modern ALSA does mixing just fine by default. Do not add PulseAudio layer unless necessary.

To determine what device corresponds to each card:
1. Connect all devices you plan to use
2. Use `aplay -l` and `arecord -l` to find the input and output card numbers.
3. Set variables in your playbook accordingly.

General logic:
1. If "primary" device is available - use it.
2. Otherwise, safely fall-back to the "secondary" one.

### Tor

`torbrowser-launcher` does not work on Wayland as Firefox in this package is compiled without the `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND`.

`torsocks` can be used to route an arbitrary application via Tor.

## Requirements

Ansible â‰¥2.9  
Debian 11 (might work on its derivatives, however this is not guaranteed)
